### 🌍 **Where Code Meets Curiosity**

Welcome to my corner of the coding world! Here, I’m building projects, exploring new technologies, and transforming ideas into interactive experiences. I’m a **Lebanese Computer science student** passionate about:

- 🌱 Making tech intuitive and impactful.
- 🌍 Building systems that bridge needs with innovative solutions.
- 🎉 Taking small steps to make big ideas happen!



 Foundations**  
Learning the building blocks— **Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C#, SQL, PHP**—and loving every step. From debugging to design, each line of code feels like solving a puzzle.
