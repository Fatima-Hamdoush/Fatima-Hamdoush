### 🌍 **Where Code Meets Curiosity**

Welcome to my corner of the coding world! Here, I’m building projects, exploring new technologies, and transforming ideas into interactive experiences. I’m a **Lebanese Computer science student** passionate about:

- 🌱 Making tech intuitive and impactful.
- 🌍 Building systems that bridge needs with innovative solutions.
- 🎉 Taking small steps to make big ideas happen!



 Foundations**  
Learning the building blocks— **Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C#, SQL, PHP**—and loving every step. From debugging to design, each line of code feels like solving a puzzle.



### 🛠️ **My Developer Toolbox**
💻 Languages : Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C#, SQL, PHP<br> 
 🌐 Web Development : HTML, CSS, ADO.NET<br> 
 🔧 Frameworks & Libraries : .NET Core <br>
 📊 Database :  MySQL   <br>
 🔄 Version Control : Git<br>

 

> *Favorite tools: Visual Studio, Planner Template, and GitHub for version control!*


#### **💡 Collaborating and Mentoring**
- Tech teacher to my sister and anyone else interested. I enjoy the “Aha!” moments, and nothing beats the thrill of solving a problem together.






### 📬 **Let’s Connect and Collaborate**

I’d love to connect, discuss ideas, and share insights. Reach out, and let’s create something extraordinary!
